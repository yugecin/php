{@h1 hi there}

Welcome on my personal home page. For all the vampires out there: there's
a link to switch to dark theme in the top right. If you stumbled upon the
dark theme but you're not a vampire, also check the link in the top right.

After having this domain for about 3-4 years, I finally put this part with
some more personal stuff on it. I've been thinking about writing random
blogposts many times before and I guess I can start doing that now :&gt;

For the interested: these pages are generated using some bash/sed scripts.
You can find the source on {@a=https://github.com/yugecin/php the github
repo of this site}
