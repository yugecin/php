An (incomplete) list of project or other stuff I'm working on or have been
working on. Only the more 'important' ones are on here, check out my
{@a=https://github.com/yugecin GitHub profile} for more (random) things.

{@h2 basdon-fly}

{@b Status:} coming soon-ish

Codename for now. Planned aviation themed {@a=http://sa-mp.com/ San Andreas

{@h2 opsu-dance}

{@b Status:} long-running, semi-paused, occasional updates

Is a fork of {@a=https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu opsu!}, which is an
open-source clone of the {@a=https://osu.ppy.sh osu!} game. My fork has more
UI/UX improvements (subjective) and contains cursor dance stuff and more
customization. I'm also a contributor to the upstream opsu! project, mostly
doing UI stuff.

games (osu!, stepmania etc). Useful for making videos or livestreaming.

{@h2 intellijplugins}

{@b Status:} partly finished

Some plugins for applications based on the Intellij Platform that make my
life better. Perhaps yours, too? Currently has a plugin for changing the "look
and feel" and a plugin that colors the caret based on the active ideavim mode.

{@h2 php}

{@b Status:} finished, maintenance

My personal home page. The thing you're probably watching right now. Is
basically a static site generator using sed and bash scripts.

{@lang-sed} {@lang-shell}

{@h2 gtasa}

{@b Status:} active

Not really a project, but I've been messing around a lot with GTA:SA, making
small scripts and hacking the game.

{@lang-asm} {@lang-none} CLEO/III-era mission code {@lang-cpp} {@lang-csharp}

{@ul

<hr/>

{@h2 tsstats}

{@b Status:} finished, maintenance

A teamspeak3 bot that idles on a server and collects statistics like user
activity, channel activity, country activity, kicks &amp; bans. Also includes a
live (updated every 5 minutes) viewer of the server.

Also has a webviewer (in a separate repo) which shows the stats in a friendly
way. Is not necessary to use, but is useful if you don't want to write your own
thing or can be used as reference.

Beware: this was written years ago and might be coded weirdly.

{@lang-java} {@lang-php}

{@ul
  {@li {@a=https://github.com/yugecin/tsstats GitHub: yugecin/tsstats}}
  {@li {@a=https://github.com/yugecin/tsstats-webviewer GitHub:

}

See it in action:

{@h2 colandreas-db-modelselector}

{@b Status:} finished

Tiny program that filters {@a=https://github.com/Pottus/ColAndreas ColAndreas}
database files. ColAndreas is a plugin for a SA-MP server to provide collision
insight in the game world. The thing is that its database file containing all
the model collision data is easily 44MB and this all ends up in memory of the
server. This script allows one to filter to data file to only contain the
models that are actually necessary, reducing the memory footprint of the server.

{@h2 txtnotes}

{@b Status:} finished, maintenance

Simple web-based plaintext notekeeper. I used this one myself a lot, every day.

{@lang-php}

{@ul
  {@li {@a=https://github.com/yugecin/txtnotes GitHub: yugecin/txtnotes}}
}

<hr/>

{@h2 plquery}

{@b Status:} finished

A php script that queries a SA-MP server to make activity graphs (using the
{@a=https://github.com/goat1000/SVGGraph SVGGraph library}). Was made for a
specific server that is now down, but can be easily modified to work for any
server.

{@lang-php}

  {@li {@a=https://robin.thisisgaming.org/pl/stats/ data (now archived since
target server doesn't exist anymore}}
