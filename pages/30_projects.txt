An (incomplete) list of project I'm working on or have been working on.

<hr/>

{@h2 basdon-fly}

{@b Status:} coming soon-ish

Codename for now. Planned aviation themed San Andreas Multiplayer server
currently under development. Also contains a website.

{@lang-pawn} {@lang-c} {@lang-java} {@lang-php}

<hr/>

{@h2 opsu-dance}

{@b Status:} long-running, paused, occasional updates

Is a fork of {@a=https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu opsu!}, which is an
open-source clone of the {@a=https://osu.ppy.sh osu!} game. My fork has more
UI/UX improvements (subjective) and contains cursor dance stuff and more
customization. I'm also a contributor to the opsu! project, mostly doing UI
stuff.

{@h2 php}

{@b Status:} finished, maintenance

My personal home page. The thing you're probably watching right now. Is
basically a static site generator using sed and bash scripts.

{@lang-sed} {@lang-shell}

{@ul
  {@li {@a=https://github.com/yugecin/php GitHub: yugecin/php}}
  {@li {@a=https://robin.basdon.net website (you're probably watching it now)}}
}

<hr/>

{@h2 tsstats}

{@b Status:} finished, maintenance

A teamspeak3 bot that idles on a server and collects statistics like user
activity, channel activity, country activity, kicks &amp; bans. Also includes a
live (updated every 5 minutes) viewer of the server.

Also has a webviewer (in a separate repo) which shows the stats in a friendly
way. Is not necessary to use, but is useful if you don't want to write your own
thing or can be used as reference.

Beware: this was written years ago and might be coded weirdly.
