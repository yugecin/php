An (incomplete) list of project or other stuff I'm working on or have been

{@h2 nfsu2-re}

{@b Status:} long-running

Hobby reverse engineering project about need for speed underground 2.
Figuring out workings and file formats. Pseudo goals are making a save game
editor and unofficial online multiplayer functionality.

{@h2 samp-mapedit}

{@b Status:} Usable state

In-game map editor for GTA: San Andreas. Also handles (race)checkpoints,
textdraws, vehicles and gangzones.
Supports SA-MP's RemoveBuilding/SetObjectMaterial/SetObjectMaterialText.

The current status is that it is usable for me, and that's all I want to do. I
made this editor mainly for me so I can get going faster on the
{@#=basdon-fly| basdon-fly project}. To actually make a decent public release,
it would require much effort to make everything work for all kinds of different
gta executables (since there's lots of memory operations) and the editor is
probably very non user friendly for anyone else than me. I don't want to spend
time on that because time is already sparse if you look at the big picture of
life and I would feel like doing that is a chore that might kill my motivation
completely.

{@h2 opsu-dance}

{@b Status:} long-running, paused/abandoned, occasional updates

Is a fork of {@a=https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu opsu!}, which is an
open-source clone of the {@a=https://osu.ppy.sh osu!} game. My fork has more
UI/UX improvements (subjective) and contains cursor dance stuff and more
customization. I'm also a contributor to the upstream opsu! project, mostly
doing UI stuff.

{@h2 intellijplugins}

{@b Status:} partly finished

and feel" and a plugin that colors the caret based on the active ideavim mode.

My personal home page. The thing you're probably looking at right now. Is
basically a static site generator using sed and bash scripts.

Not really a project, but I've been messing around a lot with GTA:SA, making

{@h2 tsstats}

{@b Status:} finished, maintenance

A teamspeak3 bot that idles on a server and collects statistics like user
activity, channel activity, country activity, kicks &amp; bans. Also includes a
live (updated every 5 minutes) viewer of the server.

Also has a webviewer (in a separate repo) which shows the stats in a friendly
way. Is not necessary to use, but is useful if you don't want to write your own
thing or can be used as reference.

Beware: this was written years ago and might be coded weirdly.

{@h2 colandreas-db-modelselector}

{@b Status:} finished

Tiny program that filters {@a=https://github.com/Pottus/ColAndreas ColAndreas}
database files. ColAndreas is a plugin for a SA-MP server to provide collision
insight in the game world. The thing is that its database file containing all
the model collision data is easily 44MB and this all ends up in memory of the
server. This script allows one to filter to data file to only contain the
models that are actually necessary, reducing the memory footprint of the server.

{@h2 plquery}

{@b Status:} finished

A php script that queries a SA-MP server to make activity graphs (using the
{@a=https://github.com/goat1000/SVGGraph SVGGraph library}). Was made for a
specific server, but can be easily modified to work for any server.
