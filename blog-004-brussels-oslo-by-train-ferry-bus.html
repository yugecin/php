			Brussels to Oslo by train/ferry/bus
		</h1>
		<p>
			I've been to Norway many times by now, and always by plane. But for
			this year's trip, I wanted to try doing it not by plane. Mostly for
			ecological reasons, as I've heard that planes are bad for the
			environment.

			<p>
				The reason it took
				2 days is because a) there was construction work on the DB rail network so
				Brussels-Köln took around 3h instead of 1h50m, b) the first trains (on Thursday)
				didn't leave that early to have enough ease of mind that I will catch all
				connections and arrive on time at the ferry, c) I postponed too much so the
				first trains of the day (Thursday) were fully booked already.

					<sup>[3]</sup> An hour into the journey, we didn't move for 45 minutes
					because of switch repairs. This delay slowly accrued to 52 minutes and
					before the final stop it came to over an hour delay, making me miss the
					connection with the Thalys that was going to bring me to Brussels.
				<li id=returnnote4>
					<sup>[4]</sup> I booked premium class on the Thalys because it was only
					&euro;3 more than standard and it would be a nice closure to the journey.
					One side effect was that premium tickets allows you to change or refund
					it up to one hour after departure. So that's what I did. Original ticket
					price was &euro;75.
				<li id=returnnote5>
					<sup>[5]</sup> Since I missed the Thalys and this was the first next
					train, I bought the most expensive ticket because it would give me access
					to the DB Lounge (and first class for this 'final' leg sounded nice).
					I've spent 2 hours before waiting in Köln Hbf on previous journeys and I
					really did not want to do that at this moment so I paid more to have comfort
					(and free drinks/snacks) in the lounge. The cheapest ticket for this journey
					would've been around &euro;80 I think.

				Comparing with plane <a href=#comparing>#</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				I've always taken Scandinavian Airlines when going Brussels-Oslo. Based on those experiences
				and a quick check, I'd guess the journey would've costed around &euro;110 outwards and &euro;90
				return (both including 1 piece of checked-in luggage). Way cheaper than &euro;372 and &euro;429.
				And it goes directly from Brussels to Oslo, no need for trains or busses. In less than 2 hours
				(flying time).
			<p>
				The ferry was a really exciting experience though, it was the first time I've been on a boat in
				open waters.

				All other ferries are from Denmark/Sweden. I've taken trains to the middle of Denmark
				before and that's also a long journey, so I was glad to see there was a ferry from
				Germany (originally The Netherlands), even if that meant I needed additional transport
				to get to Oslo.

				I have no idea. This calculation requires a plethora of factors. I'm just gonna assume
				that it was.
			<p>
				Bahn boasts that the ICE runs on 100% green electricity. The ferry I took was the
				M/S Romantika (operated by Holland Norway Lines), which was launched in 2001 (to give
				you an idea about engine efficiency I guess).

			<p>
				Possibly. I would say 'yes' faster if it wasn't for the train part of the journey, that
				part gives me the most amount of stress. It is nice that you don't have to deal with
				baggage limits, as long as you are able to haul it all yourself.
