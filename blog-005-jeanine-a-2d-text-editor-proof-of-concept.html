			It's about time I make this project public and write something about it, just for the sake
			of having the idea and this implementation out in the open, so maybe others can be inspired.

			<h2>
				TL;DR <a href=#tldr>#</a>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Code is split in blocks (manually!), which are linked together
				<li>This block configuration is stored as comments in the source file, which means editing the source in
				other editors will generally not mess up the configuration, and the configuration will be persisted when
				using using version control, though this may generate a lot of lines in commit diffs that are not related
				to your code
				<li>A 2d view of code may make it easier to remember where specific code is located (<abbr title="your mileage may vary; meaning you may not experience the same as I do">ymmv</abbr>)
				<li>Single-use functions and helpers can be moved to the side, uncluttering the more important parts of files

			<h2>
				The initial idea <a href=#theidea>#</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				I think this idea struck me at 2019/2020, probably while looking at the
				graph representation of disassembled code in IDA (The Interactive Disassembler).
			<p class=img>
				<img src=blog005/idagraph.png alt="IDA with graph view of a piece of disassembled code">
			<p>
				One of the main thoughts I had was that I wanted to shove functions to the side.
				People always say you have to split up code and functions should be short, but
				then you have a lot of functions that may only get used only once cluttering
				your file. So it seemed like a nice idea to be able to move those functions to
				the side and only have "entry" functions in the main view of a source file.
			<p>
				Another possible benefit I thought was to better visualize code flow, depending
				on how much the code is split into different blocks. Though this may be more
				applicable for assembly code like shown in IDA than typical high-level language
				code.
			<p>
				Some history:
			<ul>
				<li>I had the idea for long
				<li>mentioned it to a friend
				<li>eventually we started working on it, somewhat
				<li>named it "Odette", because we saw a file manager earlier named "Marta" and kind
				of found it was like a typical women's name from past generations. We thought
				"we can also use a cool old-sounding women's name" so "Odette" it was.
				<li>we chose C because.. I think inspired by Handmade Hero and Casey Muratori and
				Jonathan Blow etc.
				<li>It didn't really progress that fast
				<li>At some point I decided to try it in Java because I figured it would be much
				faster to prototype and it would be a good try-out of some of the concepts before
				applying it in C (I'm familiar with C but more familiar with Java and with Java Swing
				it's much easier to get going graphically for me because I don't really have experience
				with graphical stuff in C)
				<li>Called it "Jeanine" to stay with the "old women name" theme, and of course
				making it start with a J because it's a Java project
				<li>Odette became abandoned. Oops. (it never got really much traction, there was a visual
				and text could be typed but that was it pretty much)

						<p class=img>

							to jump between start/end), and then typing the command <code>:spl</code>.
						<p>
							Splitting will create a block with the selected lines, linking the block to the
							previous block (if applicable) with a bottom link. It will also create a new block
							for the rest (bottom part) of the content that is now split off from the initial block
							(if applicable), linking that block with a bottom link to the new block.
						<p>
							Changing links can be done with the <code>:link &lt;bot|right|top&gt; &lt;id&gt;</code>
							command. The <code>id</code> part is first number you see in the headers of each panel.
							Panels get ids assigned automatically (but you could change them by modifying the
							Jeanine comments, see <a href=#persistence>How block configuration is stored</a>).
							(I knew beforehand which ids each block would have in this demo, so that's why I could
							put in those command without really looking)
						<p>
							While normal (non-secondary) links define a clear parent-child relationship and
							influences the positioning of the child based on the parent's position, secondary
							links just add another line from block to block to mark related code but serve
							no other functionality. They can be added with
							<code>:slink &lt;bot|right|top&gt; &lt;id&gt;</code> and removed by doing
							<code>:unlink &lt;bot|right|top&gt; &lt;id&gt;</code>.
							Secondary links are shown in a slightly lighter gray color.
						<p>
							Blocks can be deleting by deleting all lines that define it (any linked panels will
							be re-linked to the root node). Or raw mode can be used to delete Jeanine comments
							(see <a href=#persistence>How block configuration is stored</a>).

Jeanine comments
================
Jeanine comments specify how to layout the source text. They start with a
jeanine: prefix, followed by the directive character and a colon (like p:),
followed by properties (like i:1;), optionally followed by a colon and
another directive with properties and so on. There may only be maximum one
jeanine comment on a single line.

Currently, both directives and property names are a single character in length.
Property values can be of any length, but they cannot include a semicolon.

Currently C-style block comments are always used.

If a value is a floating point number, it must include a decimal point.

Examples:

/*jeanine:p:i:1;p:0;a:b;x:0;y:30;*/
jeanine:                          standard jeanine comment prefix
  p:                        "panel" directive
    i:1;p:0;a:b;x:0;y:30;   properties and their values

/*jeanine:s:a:b;i:2;:s:a:b;i:3;*/
jeanine:                      standard jeanine comment prefix
  s:                    "secondary link" directive
    a:b;i:2;            properties and their values
	    :           directive separator
	     s:         "secondary link" directive
	       a:b;i:3; properties and their values



| Panel directive (p)
| -------------------
| These define a "panel", which is a section of text. Everything from the start
| of a panel directive until the next panel directive (or EOF) will be put in
| the same panel. Panel directives should be placed on a dedicated source line.
| The start of the source implicitely defines the root panel, which has an id
| of 0. The root panel is the only panel that has no parent.
|
|
| | Properties
| | ----------
| | - a: the anchor which specifies how this panel is attached to its parent:
| |      - b: bottom (bottom of parent linked to top of child)
| |      - t: top (top of parent linked to top of child)
| |      - r: right (requires a right link location directive; see below)
| | - i: the id of this panel
| | - p: the id of the parent of this panel
| | - x: the x-offset where this panel is located, relatively to the standard
| |      location as determined by the anchor. If this is a float value,
| |      it is a multiple of the font width, otherwise it's in pixels.
| | - y: the y-offset where this panel is located, relatively to the standard
| |      location as determined by the anchor. If this is a float value,
| |      it is a multiple of the font height, otherwise it's in pixels.



| Right link directive (r)
| ------------------------
| These define the location where panels with a 'right' anchor are linked.
| Since a right link is linked at a specific line, it needs an additional
| jeanine directive to know at which line it is linked (unlike top and bottom
| links, which are always at panel boundaries).
|
| Using a property in the panel directory to store the line number where the
| link is located would be less suitable, since it will possibly be incorrect
| after making edits in the source while not in jeanine/2d mode. Putting a
| jeanine comment at the end of the line that is linked, will survive those
| edits.
|
|
| | Properties
| | ----------
| | - i: the id of the child panel that is linked from here



| Secondary link directive (s)
| ----------------------------
| While panels are already linked by means of properties in the panel directive,
| secondary links can also be made so it is possible to have multiple links to
| the same panel. The difference between primary and secondary links is that
| a primary link defines the location of the child. A panel must always have a
| primary link (except for the root panel). Secondary links are outgoing,
| meaning they are placed at the parent's position and link to a child.
|
| Secondary links with a top or bottom anchor can be placed in a jeanine comment
| anywhere within the panel's region, but are usually put at the end. They must
| be in a jeanine comment that has its own dedicated line. That comment may then
| not contain any directives that don't require a dedicated line (like a
| secondary link with a right anchor).
|
| Secondary links with a right anchor must be placed at the end of the line
| where the link should be.
|
|
| | Properties
| | ----------
| | - i: the id of the panel that is linked here
| | - a: anchor:
| |      - b: bottom (bottom of parent linked to top of child)
| |      - t: top (top of parent linked to top of child)
| |      - r: right (this line at the parent to top of child)



| Legacy right link directive (l)
| -------------------------------
| These were in use when jeanine comments weren't fully specced out yet. They
| are deprecated and won't newly appear any more, but might still be interpreted
| for backward compatibility reasons. The 'l' initially stood for 'link'. This
| directive is the functional equivalent of 1..n right link directives (r).
|
| This directive doesn't have properties, but rather a comma separated list of
| ids that denote the child ids. (This inconsistency is the reason that it is
| deprecated)
|
|
| | Syntax
| | ------
| | /*jeanine:l:2,1*/
| |   jeanine:        standard jeanine comment prefix
| |           l:      "link" directive
| |             2,1   child panel ids that are right-linked here (2 and 1)</pre>

				Observations (the good and the bad) <a href=#observations>#</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				So far I've only really used this editor on two C projects;
				<a href=projects.html#basdon-fly>basdon</a> and <a href=projects.html#nfsu2re>nfsu2-re</a>.
			<ul>
				<li>+ confirming one of my initial thoughts, it is really nice to be able to see
				the main/entry/exposed/public functions together underneath each other as main starting
				point and have all the "helper" functions be positioned to the side, linked to their usages.
				This makes it very easy to see which functions are meant to be used an available, and which
				other functions are basically noise that are irrelevant as a user of the file. (I suppose
				an "outline" view gives the same effect in traditional IDEs, given that functions have
				the appropriate modifiers (public) or are annotated accordingly, but I don't really use
				such "outline" functionalities... maybe I should.)
				<li>+ I've noticed that I can find the code I'm looking for much quicker than before. I seem
				to automatically remember the general area in a 2d view of a file where some specific code is,
				even if I don't remember the name of the functions I'm looking for.
				<li>- Sometimes I spend too much time positioning blocks. Maybe some sort of automatic positioning
				would be nice, but I can't see it being good enough so that I won't constantly want to give it
				touch-ups.
				<li>- it can look messy if code is split mid-function, because of the code indentation. Though I rarely,
				if ever, split mid-function.
				<li>- Jeanine comments break code if they are in a block comment (if the language doesn't support nested
				block comments), so right-links or whole functions placed in a block comment (given the function has
				received its own Jeanine block) will give compile errors.
				<li>- Writing more content in blocks can make it grow over other blocks if they are positioned
				vertically. Maybe I could add some sort of "spring" links (links that make sure that blocks are
				"pushed" away when they would overlap), but that also sounds noisy in terms
				of persisting that together with the link comments. Maybe just pushing blocks out of the way without
				even such "spring" links would be a thing, but that might get messy and suddenly move everything.
				Check out the image below and I think you get the idea.

					Very similar concept, though you start with a blank canvas and can add bubbles from your source code,

					in the background, which makes it that the bubbles are made reliably based on the structure of the
					code. This also means that it has actual IDE functionality like syntax highlighting, autocomplete,
					outline etc.

					Patchworks seems like a standalone editor that shows files in a grid-like fashion. I can't seem
					to find a download for that, but Code Ribbon is a reimplementation, based on Atom.

					Not an actual implementation, but a paper discussing text editor design and the visual clutter of
					IDEs. It has a section that describes how comments could be placed in a margin, next to code, which
					reminds me of how I wanted to "move stuff to the side".
				<p>
					This paper also influenced the visuals of Jeanine a tidbit, it made me add margins inside the code
					blocks and around the code block headers, though very subtle.
				<p>
					I can agree with its description of how modern IDEs have a lot of visual clutter and only a small
					amount of space for displaying actual code. I usually try to hide a lot of things in IDEs (even tabs)
					so I can focus on the code. Ideally I'd only have a menu bar, and the main screen split between
					an area that I can switch between fileexplorer/outputconsole/other and an area for code.

					Does not put code in blocks, but provides an extra view with movable blocks that
