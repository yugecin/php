In-game map editor for GTA: San Andreas. Also handles (race)checkpoints,
textdraws, vehicles and gangzones.
Supports SA-MP's RemoveBuilding/SetObjectMaterial/SetObjectMaterialText.

The current status is that it is usable for me, and that's all I want to do. I
made this editor mainly for me so I can get going faster on the
{basdon-fly} project. To actually make a decent public release,                 ||| href
it would require much effort to make everything work for all kinds of different
gta executables (since there's lots of memory operations) and the editor is
probably very non user friendly for anyone else than me. I don't want to spend
time on that because time is already sparse if you look at the big picture of
life and I would feel like doing that is a chore that might kill my motivation
completely.

A teamspeak3 bot that idles on a server and collects statistics like user
activity, channel activity, country activity, kicks & bans. Also includes a
live (updated every 5 minutes) viewer of the server.

Also has a webviewer (in a separate repo) which shows the stats in a friendly
way. Is not necessary to use, but is useful if you don't want to write your own
thing or can be used as reference.

Beware: this was written years ago and might be coded weirdly.

Tiny program that filters {ColAndreas} database files. ColAndreas is a plugin   ||| a class=ext href=https://github.com/Pottus/ColAndreas
for SA-MP servers to provide collision insights about the game world.
The thing is that its database file containing all the model collision data
is easily 44MB and this all ends up in memory of the server.
This script allows one to filter to data file to only contain the models that
are actually necessary, reducing the memory footprint of the server.
